# üç≥ Cookmate Mobile App

## Overview

**Cookmate** is your smart kitchen companion, designed to take the guesswork out of cooking with what you already have at home.

Simply snap a photo of your fridge or pantry, and Cookmate will detect the ingredients for you. You can easily add or remove items to match your real inventory.

Once your ingredients are set, personalize your experience by selecting dietary preferences like:

* Intolerances
* Diet type
* Cuisine
* Dish type
* Serving time
* Equipment Level (Basic for beginner cooks, Medium for regular home cook equipments, Advanced if you have a well equipped kitchen)
* Nutritional goals (e.g., minimum protein, carbs, fats)

After setting your preferences, ask the **AI Chef** to either **create a custom recipe** or **find one online** that suits your needs.

You'll receive a full recipe breakdown including:

* Required ingredients
* Step-by-step cooking instructions
* Necessary kitchen equipment
* Nutritional information per dish
